# MACHINE-LEARNING

The .ipynb file consists of a jupyter notebook with the code for Cnn

You can go to colab by google (https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload and extract the dataset.rar and the test images to easily test the model;
You are free to add your own images and rename them to test.jpg to test the model and see if it predicts correctly 

^Model trained on the similar plants and chairs and hence has an accuracy for 100% unless different types of plants/ chair images are to be predicted by the model
